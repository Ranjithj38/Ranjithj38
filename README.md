## Topic: Morphological Image Processing
Morphological image processing involves operations that process images based on shapes. It is primarily used for the analysis of binary images but can be extended to grayscale images. These techniques are often used to:
Remove noise
Fill holes
Extract or enhance structures
Perform shape analysis
Improve results of edge-based or threshold-based segmentation

Common Morphological Operations:
Erosion: Shrinks bright regions (removes small noise)
Dilation: Expands bright regions (fills small holes)
Opening: Erosion followed by dilation (removes small objects)
Closing: Dilation followed by erosion (fills small holes)

Steps:
1.Load and Convert Image to Grayscale or Binary
2.Thresholding (if needed)
3.Define a Structuring Element (Kernel)
4.Apply Morphological Operations (Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing)
5.Find and Draw Contours
6.Display the Results
